# commodity impact on rates
## Does the type of commodity impact the rates? Why does the type of commodity impact the rates? Should the commodity type change the rate?
## Yes absolutely!  All too often trucking company employees will record a general description in the commodity field.  This is problematic because truckloads moving from point A to point B can have significantly different rates.  Old corrugated cardboard (OCC) moves for rates often found in market segment 1 while copper wire often moves for rates found in market segment 4.  Carriers who are good at what they do have different rates depending on the commodity.
